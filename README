xml-embedded
************

This is a minimalistic 24/7 xml parser sample with rich diagnostics.
The main architecture goals:

1) small footprint

2) fast operation

3) minimum reallocations

4) maximum range checks

The testing application reads XML file paths from stdin and collects
information from them. Using the obtained information it makes some
kind of data scheme covered with given XML files.

To build a testing application do the following:

1) clone, make build directory

$ git clone path/to/repo/xml-embedded.git
$ mkdir xml-embedded/obj

2) generate configure script (you must have autoconf installed)

$ cd xml-embedded
$ autoreconf -i -f

3) generate build configuration anm make

$ cd obj
$ ../configure
$ make
